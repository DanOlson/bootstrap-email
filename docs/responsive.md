    <span class="badge-check">
      <img src="/img/icons/check.svg" />
    </span>
    <span>Responsive</span>
  </a>
</span> badge it means the component has responsive breakpoints for different sized screens. Similar to Bootstrap, we support <code>lg</code> and <code>sm</code> device breakpoints. The breakpoint is anything 600px or wider is considered <code>lg</code> and anything under 600px is <code>sm</code>.

Not everything that is reponsive uses these names. For example the <code>.container</code> is responsive by default and expands and contracts on different screens.
